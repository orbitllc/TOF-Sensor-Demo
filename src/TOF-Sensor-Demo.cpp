  SparkFun labored with love to create the library used in this sketch. Feel like supporting open source hardware?

  Also, I got early inspiration from a project by Jan - https://github.com/BasementEngineering/PeopleCounter
  But, I needed to change the logic to better match my way of thinking.  Thank you Jan for getting me started!

  This example proves out some of the TOF sensor capabilitites we need to validate:
  - Abiltiy to Sleep and wake on range interrupt
  - Once awake, to determine if an object is moving parallel, toward or away from the sensor
  - Ability to deal with edge cases: Door closings, partial entries, collisions, chairs, hallway passings, etc.

// v1.00 - For testing purposes put into "testing mode" to get rapid output via usb serial
// v2.00 - Will stay disconnected to simplfy code - Just trying to implement directionality
// v2.01 - First version for testing
// v2.02 - Changing oritentation to match ST Micro example code
// v2.03 - Added a buffer to find the minimum deistance in buffer set in the config file
// v3.00 - Removed most logic in favor of a simple getSignalBySpad() approach.
// v4.00 - Implemented the "magicalStateMap" algorithm, which replaced the FSM. Counts now change when sufficiently BELOW baseline. Helps detect black.
